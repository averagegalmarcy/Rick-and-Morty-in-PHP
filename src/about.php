    That\'s Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know. It\'s gonna make sense. I\'m Mr. Crowbar, and here is my friend, 
    who is also a crowbar! Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you\'re aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a
    grape? Is he keeping his shoulders square? Oooooooh he\'s tryin!
    <br></br>
    There\'s pros and cons to every alternate timeline. Fun facts about this one â€“ It\'s got giant, telepathic spiders, 11 9/11s, and the best ice cream in the multiverse! Are you kidding? I\'m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick! 
    "And"? What more do you want tacked on to this? "I turned myself into a pickle, 
    and 9/11 was an inside job"? Don\'t break an arm jerking yourself off Morty.</p>';
